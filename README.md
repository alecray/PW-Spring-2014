PW-Spring-2014
==============
For this Project Week we are creating an app prototype. 
The app will be for iPhone. The user will create an account which they can use to sell and buy objects that are being sold in their area by other people with accounts. Users will also be able to rate other users, and chat with them in order to purchase items. Initially all purchases will be handled by people themselves, not the app.
